## Hi there. Nice to meet you.

### Introduction
 My name is Marc LeVan, and I welcome you to my electronic portfolio. I am a Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) candidate at the University of South Carolina, where I have majored in mass communication and minored in English. I am graduating with honors (cum laude) in May of 2022. Upon graduation, I will concurrently pursue a Juris Doctor (J.D.) at the University of Maryland Francis King Carey School of Law and a Master of Business Administration (M.B.A.) at the Johns Hopkins University Carey Business School.
 
 I did not aspire to a career in law when I began college. As a student in USC’s College of Information and Communications (CIC), I initially planned on a career in journalism or public relations. I have always enjoyed writing, and I knew it was a viable path for me when I won the Silver Key Scholastic Art and Writing Award from the Savannah College of Art and Design (SCAD) at the age of 17.
	During my time in the CIC, I completed numerous media law and communication philosophy courses. While I enjoyed learning about everything from legal history to the theories of persuasion, my greatest takeaway from these classes was that my writing could make a palpable difference in someone’s life. Of course, journalism also has the power to ameliorate lives, but in a different capacity than law. As an attorney, I will be not only a writer but also a direct advocate and personal defender for those in need.
	
 I plan to focus my legal and business studies on intellectual property and technology law. This curriculum will allow me to amalgamate my theoretical knowledge of communication and media law with practical training to exercise my expertise in the legal field. Furthermore, a business degree will provide interdisciplinary training and allow me to conceptualize my legal studies in the broader context of business and economics.
 
 My interest in this legal genre stems from its ramifications on daily life. I believe that our society is on the precipice of a technological renaissance (e.g., artificial intelligence, virtual and augmented reality, supercomputing, etc.). Our legal system will face novel yet exciting challenges. Scientific organizations, think tanks, and tech startups will require intellectual property attorneys to assist in copyright litigation, patent creation, trademarks and trade secrets protection, and much more. While entering a perpetually evolving legal field is daunting, I am excited to be at the forefront of its development.
 
 Outside of my upcoming law and business classes, I plan to spend the next few years interning and networking around the Mid-Atlantic. Hopefully, I will cultivate many hands-on experiences (e.g., summer internships, judicial clerkships, journal publications, etc.) that complement my classroom knowledge. I am also looking forward to living in Baltimore and soaking up the city’s history and culture!
	
 While my postgrad trajectory is far from my initial aspirations, I would not be on this path had I not attended the University of South Carolina. My time within and beyond the classrooms of the CIC has contributed to several key insights, which I explore in the following sections of this portfolio. Thank you for reading, and please feel free to reach out via phone, email, or LinkedIn.
