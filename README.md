### Contact
For all general inquiries, please email silentpool [dot] info [at] gmail [dot] com.

### Demo Policy
If you think that your work would be a good fit on the label, send **links** of your portfolio to silentpool [dot] demos [at] gmail [dot] com. We will discard emails with attached files. 

Even though we will view all correctly sent submissions, the label does have a specific aesthetic. Bear this in mind before you send us your "sick" beats and "fire" EDM tracks.
