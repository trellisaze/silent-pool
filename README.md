## Hi there. Nice to meet you.

### Introduction
My name is Marc LeVan, and I welcome you to my electronic portfolio. I am a Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) candidate at the University of South Carolina, where I have majored in mass communication and minored in English. I am graduating with honors (cum laude) in May of 2022. Upon graduation, I will concurrently pursue a Juris Doctor (J.D.) at the University of Maryland Francis King Carey School of Law and a Master of Business Administration (M.B.A.) at the Johns Hopkins University Carey Business School.
 
I did not aspire to a career in law when I began college. As a student in USC’s College of Information and Communications (CIC), I initially planned on a career in journalism or public relations. I have always enjoyed writing, and I knew it was a viable path for me when I won the Silver Key Scholastic Art and Writing Award from the Savannah College of Art and Design (SCAD) at the age of 17.

During my time in the CIC, I completed numerous media law and communication philosophy courses. While I enjoyed learning about everything from legal history to the theories of persuasion, my greatest takeaway from these classes was that my writing could make a palpable difference in someone’s life. Of course, journalism also has the power to ameliorate lives, but in a different capacity than law. As an attorney, I will be not only a writer but also a direct advocate and personal defender for those in need.
	
I plan to focus my legal and business studies on intellectual property and technology law. This curriculum will allow me to amalgamate my theoretical knowledge of communication and media law with practical training to exercise my expertise in the legal field. Furthermore, a business degree will provide interdisciplinary training and allow me to conceptualize my legal studies in the broader context of business and economics.
 
My interest in this legal genre stems from its ramifications on daily life. I believe that our society is on the precipice of a technological renaissance (e.g., artificial intelligence, virtual and augmented reality, supercomputing, etc.). Our legal system will face novel yet exciting challenges. Scientific organizations, think tanks, and tech startups will require intellectual property attorneys to assist in copyright litigation, patent creation, trademarks and trade secrets protection, and much more. While entering a perpetually evolving legal field is daunting, I am excited to be at the forefront of its development.
 
Outside of my upcoming law and business classes, I plan to spend the next few years interning and networking around the Mid-Atlantic. Hopefully, I will cultivate many hands-on experiences (e.g., summer internships, judicial clerkships, journal publications, etc.) that complement my classroom knowledge. I am also looking forward to living in Baltimore and soaking up the city’s history and culture!
	
While my postgrad trajectory is far from my initial aspirations, I would not be on this path had I not attended the University of South Carolina. My time within and beyond the classrooms of the CIC has contributed to several key insights, which I explore in the following sections of this portfolio. Thank you for reading, and please feel free to reach out via phone, email, or LinkedIn.
  
 
### Key Insights Within the Classroom

Like many college students, I began my educational journey without knowing the end goal. What industry would I work in? Where geographically speaking would I work? Perhaps most of all, how would I use the skills I have cultivated during my tenure in the school of journalism? The COVID-19 pandemic began during my second year as a mass communications major, and, as a result, I felt more lost than ever before.

In autumn of 2020, I entered Journalism 303: Law and Ethics of Mass Communication, which Dr. Erik Collins taught. It is a required course for mass communication majors, and I went into the class assuming that it would simply be another “box to check” to graduate. Up until then, I had studied journalistic writing, marketing, and public relations. Why would I have an interest in the law? I, unfortunately, carried this belief into class initially, which resulted in me refraining from active participation. I did not read all of the required texts or take important notes.

Nevertheless, Dr. Collins saw potential in me. He taught the course using the Socratic method, in which students read and take notes before class. The professor reviews the essential concepts in class, often calling on students to answer questions and explain the material. Worried about being called on, I began reading more of the material and taking notes beforehand. I developed an intense curiosity and interest in media law in doing so. I became fascinated by the interplay between legal disputes and our communicative practices, and I enjoyed the abstract and open-ended nature of the material (i.e., there was not an “easy solution” to any of the cases we studied).

My growing interest in the class must have become apparent. I began coming to class early to ask Dr. Collins additional questions about the readings. He called on me frequently during lectures, but I started feeling prepared to answer his questions and excited to contribute to class discussions. At one point, he instructed me to stand in front of the class, where I summarized vital facts and opinions from New York Times Co. v. United States. It was a landmark Supreme Court case that occurred during the height of the Vietnam War. The justices grappled with a dilemma: defining the first amendment’s guidelines in the context of wartime censorship.

Dr. Collins gave me more than 30 pages of courtroom documents and the Pentagon Papers (see artifact no. 1). After studying these materials, I had to summarize both the facts of the case (i.e., the background and how it was elevated to the Supreme Court) and the arguments of each justice. Following my presentation, Dr. Collins had me think critically about the repercussions of the court’s decision and apply the court’s reasoning to solve similar (yet hypothetical) cases. It was a difficult assignment, and I am sure that most of my peers would not have enjoyed it. However, I enjoyed this classroom experience and looked forward to similar assignments and tests later in the semester.

This within the classroom experience opened my eyes and answered many of the questions above. With Dr. Collins’ encouragement, it was clear that I would thrive in a legal career. The course content allowed me to realize my interest in law’s relationship with mass communication and develop an affinity for analyzing abstract theories and practices of mass communications.

I carried these passions into ensuing courses, such as Journalism 306: Theories of Mass Communication. In this class, which Dr. Kenneth Campbell taught, I applied much of the same analytical thinking and reasoning skills that I had cultivated from Journalism 303. For instance, my final paper for Dr. Campbell was an exploration of cultivation analysis theory within the context of video games (see artifact no. 2). While not necessarily grappling with the same issues presented in Dr. Collins’ teaching, this paper nevertheless allowed me to explore the interplay between communication and technology and articulate the effects of that interplay on our culture and society. I believe that this experience was analogous to my presentation of New York Times Co. v. United States. I explored the repercussions of cultivation analysis similarly to my exploration of the implications of the Supreme Court’s verdict.

I firmly believe that Journalism 303 was the most crucial college career class. Through it, I found a love for the abstract side of mass communication theories, as well as a calling to explore these theories in the context of a legal career. I found this calling through my presentation of New York Times Co. v. United States, which inspired me to continue analyzing the effects of mass communications (particularly in a legal context) on our culture and society.  Thus, the experience became the impetus for my law school journey, which would not have begun without my participation in the law and ethics of mass communication.


### Key Insights Outside the Classroom

The summer internship is a paragon of outside-the-classroom experience. It allows students to apply what they have learned, network with the industry’s current practitioners, and cultivate expertise for their CVs. Perhaps most importantly, internships are simulacrums of careers; they allow students to experience an industry before fully immersing in it. I found my previous internship most valuable for this reason, as it altered my post-graduation career trajectory.

Last summer, I interned at Chernoff Newman, an integrated communications agency headquartered in Columbia, South Carolina. Entering the agency’s public relations department, I was excited to apply my textbook knowledge to “real world” situations. In this regard, the experience was stellar. I ghostwrote press releases, communicated with clients and media outlets, managed social media accounts, edited copy, and orchestrated advertising campaigns. My portfolio included high-profile clients, such as Walmart and the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association.

Furthermore, being the only intern in the Columbia office, I received one-on-one mentorship from the agency’s practitioners. This coaching was the most crucial facet of my internship, as I received continual feedback on my performance. This made it evident that my performance was “above average” compared to previous interns. After drafting a press release for Flagship (see artifact no. 1), a medical real estate developer, my supervisor commented that “[Marc]’s really good…it’s rare to see an intern write that well.”  During my exit interview, the president of public relations stated that “given the opportunity, we would hire you in an instant.”

At first, these comments were reassurance that I was on the right career trajectory. After all, why wouldn’t I pursue a career in public relations if I’m an adept practitioner? Yet, as I left my internship in August, I couldn’t help but feel slightly dissatisfied. This was by no means directed at Chernoff Newman itself. The internship, as previously stated, was a stellar experience overall, and I do not regret the experience in the slightest. Instead, I felt dissatisfied with my role in the industry at large.

In essence, I left the office each day feeling as though my work made little difference in the world. Sure, it was exciting to write press releases for Walmart or manage social media accounts for state government agencies. Yet, I felt that these actions weren’t truly helping anyone. I assisted large organizations in bolstering their public image and increasing the bottom line, but I wasn’t helping society. Thus, the most satisfying moments of my internship were when I felt that I made someone’s life better. For instance, I drafted social media content for Summer Break Café (see artifact no. 2), a state-sponsored program providing meals to low-income schoolchildren during the summer. My work allowed the program to reach a wider audience and subsequently increased the number of children served. This was satisfying because I made a tangible difference in the community, rather than helping a fortune 500 company increase its profits.  

Similarly, I ghostwrote press releases and newsletters for DreamKey Partners, a nonprofit real estate developer in Charlotte, North Carolina. The nonprofit develops, renovates, and manages affordable housing for the community while preserving historical architecture and neighborhood culture (i.e., preventing gentrification). A gratifying moment occurred months after the conclusion of my internship; as I drove through Charlotte, I noticed a billboard advertising DreamKey’s continued community involvement, and I felt satisfied knowing that my work helped the organization get there.

With these particular experiences in mind, I developed new expectations for my future career. Despite possessing the knowledge and skillset for public relations, I now knew I wanted to work for communities, not corporations. Furthermore, I wanted to do more than compose social media content and press correspondence; I wanted to advocate and defend. Reflecting on my classroom experience with media law and ethics, I knew that a legal career would allow me to embody these roles. Subsequently, I pivoted from a trajectory into public relations into a post-grad career in law.

While I may not find myself in the world of public relations, I am nevertheless grateful for my internship at Chernoff Newman. It allowed me to sharpen my communication skills and demonstrated why a career in public relations might not be the best fit for me. Some may see this as an “undesirable” outcome, as the hope would be that an internship solidifies one’s interest in a career path. While it is vexing that my career path has shifted, I view this shift as a positive one; I now have a more robust conception of how to use my skills and whom to help with those skills.
