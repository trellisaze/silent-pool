## Dive Into the Silent Pool

### Backstory
Silent Pool was created by Marc LeVan, a musician and photographer from Atlanta. We are interested in ambient and experimental music, as well as abstract visual art. Our ethos is that when it comes to art, there are no rules. 
 
### Aural Projects
Music can be purchased on [Bandcamp](https://marclevan.bandcamp.com/releases) and streamed on Spotify, Apple Music, and Soundcloud.  

### Visual Projects
Prints can be purchased on [VSUAL](https://www.vsual.co/shop/silent-pool) and [ArtPal](https://www.artpal.com/silentpool).

### Demo Policy
If you think that your work would be a good fit for this platform, send **links** of your portfolio to silentpooldemos [at] gmail [dot] com. Emails with attached files will be deleted.

While we will view all submissions that are correctly sent, the label does have a specific aesthetic. We do not care how sick your latest trap beat is; send it to someone else.
