## Dive In

### Backstory
Silent Pool was created by Marc LeVan, a musician and photographer from Atlanta. He wanted to establish a platform for his creative projects. The label currently carries his work exclusively.   

Silent Pool specializes in ambient and minimalistic music. The label also publishes visual art, and future plans include distributing written works.
