## Dive In

### Backstory
Silent Pool was created by Marc LeVan, a musician and photographer from Atlanta. He wanted to establish a platform for esoteric and underappreciated art. In other words, his goal is to go against the grain, and to break all the rules.  

Silent Pool specializes in ambient and minimalistic music. We also publish abstract visual art, and future plans include distributing written works.   
 
### Aural Projects
Music can be purchased on [Bandcamp](https://silentpool.bandcamp.com/music) and streamed on Spotify, Apple Music, and [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/silentpoolrecords).  

### Visual Projects
Prints can be purchased on [VSUAL](https://www.vsual.co/shop/silent-pool) and [ArtPal](https://www.artpal.com/silentpool). 

### Social Media
Our primary social medium is [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/silentpoolrecords/), but we occasionally upload content on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbPh-fLeBOlBwV4hKPKE7sg/) as well. 

### Contact
For all general inquiries, please email silentpool [dot] info [at] gmail [dot] com.

### Demo Policy
If you think that your work would be a good fit on the label, send **links** of your portfolio to silentpool [dot] demos [at] gmail [dot] com. We will discard emails with attached files. 

Even though we will view all correctly sent submissions, the label does have a specific aesthetic. Bear this in mind before you send us your "sick" beats and "fire" EDM tracks.
